<h1>About</h1>

<p class="lead">Lyrics Analyzer is a simple web application built to
  experiment with Play Framework and Scala, combined with a Single-Page
  Application pattern based on AngularJS and using a Bootstrap design.</p>

<p class="lead">Besides being a programmer's playground, we also
  provide an aggregated analysis of a set of user-selected lyrics,
  showing word clouds for the most relevant terms.</p>
