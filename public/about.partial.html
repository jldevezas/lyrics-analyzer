    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="lead">Lyrics Analyzer is a simple web application
      built to experiment with Play Framework and Scala, combined with a
      Single-Page Application pattern based on AngularJS and using a
      Bootstrap design.</p>

    <p class="lead">Besides being a programmer's playground, we also
      provide an aggregated analysis of a set of user-selected lyrics,
      showing word clouds for the most relevant terms.</p>
